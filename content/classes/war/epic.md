# Part 1 – Red Scabbard
- Head to East Freeport and find Kargek Redblade. Say “what favor” to receive Wax Sealed Note.
- Head to Feerrott, give Oknoggin Stonesmasher your Wax Sealed Note to receive Tiny Lute.
- Head back to East Freeport, give Kargek Redblade your Tiny Lute to receive Redblade’s Legacy. Hold onto it.
- Head to Permafrost Keep, kill a goblin wizard and/or a goblin warlock. Loot a Heart of Frost. It is a fairly common drop. While you’re here, you can grab a Block of Permafrost from the ice giant area if you want. You’ll need it later in the quest (See Part 2 – there are two options).
- Head to East Karana, give Tenal Redblade your Redblade’s Legacy to receive Totem of the Freezing War. Tenal Redblade can be found on the far east side of the zone at the bottom of the gorge below the Highpass Hold zoneline.
- Give Tenal Redblade both the Totem of the Freezing War and Heart of Frost to receive Totem of Fiery War.

At this point the only items you should have are Totem of Fiery War and Block of Permafrost.

Next, we will need to  collect 4 items from raid bosses:
- Green Dragon Scales – (Tradable) – Drops from:
  - Severilous – Emerald Jungle
  - Hoshkar – Veeshan’s Peak
- Red Dragon Scales – (Tradable) – Drops from:
  - Lord Nagafen – Nagafen’s Lair
  - Echo of Nortlav – The Hole (2.0 Only?)
  - Talendor – Skyfire Mountains
- Hand of the Maestro – Drops in Plane of Hate from Hand of the Maestro. Drop rate supposedly varies based on era. I have always gotten it on the first kill (did the quest twice, and killed him more often than that). You can also spawn him via an instance. Respawn time reported 12 hours, but I have not confirmed.
- Spiroc Wingblade – Drops in Plane of Sky on Island 5 from The Spiroc Lord. He death touches so bringing two tanks and and someone to resurrect is ideal. If you leave The Spiroc Guardian up (Island 5 boss), The Spiric Lord will respawn upon death, meaning you can farm him for multiple Spiroc Wingblade. It does not always drop, so it is recommended to use this method if The Spiroc Lord is not visibly holding it.

Once all four items are obtained, head back to East Karana to Tenal Redblade.

First give him: Green Dragon Scales, Red Dragon Scales, Totem of Fiery War to receive Mark of the Sword.

Then give him: Mark of the Sword and Hand of the Maestro to receive Tenal’s note to Kargek.

Now go back to East Freeport and find Kargek Redblade. Give him Spiroc Wingblade and Tenal’s note to Kargek to receive Red Scabbard.
