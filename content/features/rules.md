### Rules

In general, RebuildEQ is a relaxed server. We want you to have fun and enjoy the game. However, there are a few rules to keep in mind:

- MQ2 is NOT allowed
- Boxing is not allowed
- Be kind to others. No racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. No harassment. No spamming. No exploiting. No botting. No cheating. No griefing. No drama. No politics. No religion. No hate speech. No trolling. No scamming. No begging. No stealing. No killing players. No training. Be nice, please.

### Server Rulesets

- There are no class / race penalties
- There are no ZEMs currently, hunt where you like (likely be tweaked later for dungeons)
- Group incentives
