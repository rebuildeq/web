### Rules

In general, RebuildEQ is a relaxed server. We want you to have fun and enjoy the game. However, there are a few rules to keep in mind:

- MQ2 is allowed without active hacks such as warp, instacamp, etc.
- Boxing is not directly prohibited but discouraged. Play with your friends, or try out RebuildEQ solo. We'll cater content to be trivialized by a small group of players.
- Be kind to others. No racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. No harassment. No spamming. No exploiting. No botting. No cheating. No griefing. No drama. No politics. No religion. No hate speech. No trolling. No scamming. No begging. No stealing. No killing players. No training. Be nice, please.
