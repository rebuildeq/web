Vitality is a system reimagined in RebuildEQ that grants bonus experience. Instead of gaining buffs or hidden stats with a fixed % of exp like normal EQ, Rebuild uses the vitality system. You can see your vitality in game by looking at your experience bar, you'll see a thin green bar below it.

With Vitality, you can gain experience faster, but it will deplete over time. The more vitality you have, the more experience you will gain.

This system is designed to help players who may not have as much time to play, or who may be returning to the game after a long break. It allows you to catch up and enjoy the game without feeling like you are falling behind.

## How to gain vitality

You gain vitality in 3 different ways, and each way stack with each other:

- Resting: When you enter safe zones (towns, designated areas) you will get a buff and an emote notifying that you are in a rested area. If you log out or stay in these areas, your character will gain vitality over time. It will take 42 hours to cap this vitality.
- Events: Holiday events, weekend bonuses, and other community events will give you a boost to your vitality. These events will be announced, and logging in during the event will be enough to obtain this vitality. Vitality gained via events will have an expiration time, usually 1 week after the event ends, and has no cap, but it is only given for special occasions.
- Activities: When in towns, there will be simple activities available by interacting with NPCs. These activities will give you another form of vitality. They have their own cap and you'll be notified when you reach it or are nearing reaching it in game as you do activities.

Note that these 3 sources of vitality are independent and are summarized with the vitality progress bar. If the total is over the experience needed for your next level, vitality will show at 100%. As you consume vitality, it will retain 100% until the total amount of vitality remaining is less than the experience needed for your next level.

## How to use vitality

When you gain experience, you will bonus experience and consume vitality. Your exp gain message will tell you how much was added from vitality. The more vitality you have, the faster vitality is used, slowing down as you get closer to fully exhausting the vitality reserves. Which source of vitality is consumed is 50/50 rested and event, then once both of these are exhausted, activities.
