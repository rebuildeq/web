Vitality is a system reimagined in RebuildEQ. You can see your vitality in game by looking at your experience window, you'll see a thin green bar below it.

With Vitality, you can gain experience faster, but it will deplete over time. The more vitality you have, the more experience you will gain. However, if you run out of vitality, you will not gain any experience until you rest or do activities to gain it back.
This system is designed to help players who may not have as much time to play, or who may be returning to the game after a long break. It allows you to catch up and enjoy the game without feeling like you are falling behind.

## How to gain vitality

You gain vitality in 3 different ways, and each way stack with each other:

- Resting: When you enter safe zones (towns, designated areas) you will get a buff and an emote notifying that you are in a rested area. If you log out or stay in these areas, your character will gain vitality over time. It will take 42 hours to cap this vitality.
- Events: Holiday events, weekend bonuses, and other community events will give you a boost to your vitality. These events will be announced. Vitality gained via events will have an expiration time, usually 1 week after the event ends.
- Activities: When in towns, there will be simple activities available by interacting with NPCs. These activities will give you another form of vitality.

## How to use vitality

When you gain experience, you will consume vitality. The amount of vitality consumed is based on the amount of experience you gain. The more vitality you have, the more experience you will gain. You can see how much vitality you have in your experience window. The more vitality you have, the faster vitality is used, slowing down as you get closer to fully exhausting the reserves.
