When you log out at the end of the day, there are special areas (typically towns) that give you a buff called Rested. These areas when logged out of (or if you hang out at) slowly recover your vitality pool.

Category 1 pool:
"Rested" <-- recharges 12 hours equal to 1 hour of exp bonus, if you log in 1 hour every 12 hours, you'd be playing exactly the rested?
max pool of rested exp is met at 42 hours of not playing,

Your next level's exp pool requirement affects the max rested amount.

Category 2 pool:
- Vials of Experience
- other forms of like, weekend bonus exp

fixed % exp bonuses via buff. Lessons of the devoted, 50% exp weekends

"50% weekend"

150% of level exp weekends
