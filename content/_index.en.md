## Features
{{< columns >}}
- Group-focused. Expect to play with friends for the best experience. Content will be tuned to require no more than 6, but many situations will at least need 2 players
- Take advantage of the new [rested system](/features/rested), allowing you to pool bonus experience while in a town or city when online or offline
- Casual friendly. Baseline game will be grindy, but systems are in place to help your first 2 hours a day be accelerated and other daily quests allow more casual players to play at their own pace. 1-60 is aimed to take 1 to 2 months with about 2 hours of play time from zero to hero
- [Build system]([build](/builds/clr/)). Every time you level up, you're granted an AA point that you can spend on unique build skills
- AAs are quested. AAs can be unlocked by doing quests that are one time permanent unlocks of an entire AA, instead of grinding
- Augs are simplified. As you hunt Norrath and consider mobs, you'll see (tags) that give hints of what cards they may drop
<--->
- Original content [has been expanded](/features/custom-content). Adds over 13 custom NPC nameds, as well as more than 175 custom items (More will be added)
- Salvage systems helps with earning money. A salvage box will help you recycle any items that drop into salvaged parts which can be then be sold at merchants. No items need to rot any more on corpses!
- Convienences are available from Guild Masters, but have a hefty cost after level 10. Wizards and Druids Guildmasters can teleport you. Clerics, Shamans, Enchanters can buff you. Hail Guild masters and learn their services. The price goes up significantly over time, however, so rolling the actual class is recommended to keep costs down
