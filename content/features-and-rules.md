### Goals

Jamfest EQ goal is to collect feedback for projects like ProjectEQ and EQEmu. This is done with the `/bug` command, which you are encouraged to use in game. Try to avoid duplicating your own issues, and don't worry about coordinating with others. Volunteers are assisting behind the scenes with triaging issues as they come in. Don't expect any of them to immediately be repaired, but if you do find something that is game breaking, please report it to a GM in game. We are going to take all these issues and create a list of things to fix for each external project.

Jamfest is currently in alpha, and our goal is instead of changing Jamfest's content db, we change PEQ's db, and trickle it back to jamfest after PEQ updates. This means changes we do affect all future servers who base on PEQ.

We also want to discover and capture expansions not currently handled by the PEQ team (who is at DoN). This means aiming up to Rain of Fear.

Due to the sheer volume of content missing in future expansions, we will be looking at ways to create "lite editions", that gives players goals and achievements in a condensed manner.

### Features

Many custom features in jamfest are opt in. This is so players can jam in Jamfest EQ the way they want to. The following are some of the features you can opt in to:

- `#opt` by itself will give saylinks of each option, and it's current status
- `#opt 4x` gives a 4x boost to EXP
- `#opt exp_debug` enables a message of how your EXP multipliers are applied
- `#opt mighty` gives a boost to your outgoing damage, and reduces incoming.   
    - vs normal mobs, 2x dmg, 0.5x dmg taken
    - vs raid mobs, 6x dmg, 0.16x dmg taken
- `#opt mighty_debug` enables a message of how your mighty multipliers are being applied
- `#opt catchup` gives a additive 10x boost that curves up to 38x, currently stops at level 51

Many more features will be added as we go, and we are always open to suggestions via #issue

### Rules

In general, Jamfest is a relaxed server. We want you to have fun and enjoy the game. However, there are a few rules to keep in mind:

- MQ2 is allowed without active hacks such as warp, instacamp, etc.
- Boxing is not directly prohibited but discouraged. Play with your friends, or try out jamfest solo. We'll cater content to be trivialized by a small group of players.
- Be kind to others. No racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. No harassment. No spamming. No exploiting. No botting. No cheating. No griefing. No drama. No politics. No religion. No hate speech. No trolling. No scamming. No begging. No stealing. No killing players. No training. Be nice, please.
